they made this joke easy

## so what's this repo about?
this repo contains my scripting journey. it contains my powershell and linux scripts, both broken and operational, that show my trials and tribulations along with my dry sense of humor. I encourage anyone that encounters any of my broken scripts to fix them, and if any scripts can be made simpler I'd be open to all of the learning experiences of those as well.

## How do these scripts help me?
These scripts help me understand what I've been learning at Code Fellows. as I learn each new command and had to introduce them into the script I get a deeper understanding of them. even more when I have to tie them into things like functions and variables. understanding what scripts these commands could be used in is part of the fundamentals of scripting. I cant use a linux script in powershell and vice versa. these fundamentals aren't just important for scripting but for understanding software in general. automation, security breaches, etc. all have some form of script in it typically so understanding these foundations will piece everything together as i develop.

## my favoorite script so far.
my favorite scrript I have done so far would probably be the first one I did, or it's at least one of the first. At the time I was learning what's known as the "echo" command. i Atually learned two versions of command with the other one being "printf". If you look at it now It should still look like someone clueless was making it which is why it's my favorite. while I was looking up one simple command to print the line I wanted to say on the screen I ran into variables. So after I figured out the echo and printf commands I tried to use variables in that function and from wat I remember I failed horribly but it didn't matter because it wasn't part of the objective anyway. luckily enough a few days later I was introduced to the concept of variables and messing with thtem in that script and knowing where I went wrong helped me when it was time to put them to use. that script schow how far I've developed as a coding student and it will probably be a common foundation that I would use in a working environment. if I'm setting up automations that would require the user to interact then I'd likely be using echo and some variables pretty freuently in the script.

## where I could improve
I'd say my scripts that loop need some major tuning because I don't really think I understand loops. I know what loops are, I know their purpose and that they can even be dangerous. What I don't understand is the construction of them in a script. for some reason I can put one together after messing with it for about an hour but I'll look at it and be like "I don't even know how I did that it just works" I'd practice more on my script titled loops, but I'd definitely need to do some research which could be time consuming. 

## enjoy the jokes
most of my scripting challenges contain puns based on the title of the challenge given for that day and i hope you have a nice giggle out of them. Enjoy folks!
